## The Challenge

One of the biggest challenges people face in designing for positive change is moving from good intentions to concrete actions.

> ‚ÄúWhere can we start? It all feels so overwhelming!‚Äù
‚ÄùWhat tools, best practices and frameworks can help us put things into practice?‚Äù
‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know how to do this ‚Äî who is already doing this work that we can learn from?‚Äù
> 

There are so many wonderful resources that already exist. But it can be difficult to find them. Existing resource libraries often go out of date and can be overwhelming to navigate through with long lists of resources.

<aside>
üí° **What is Design for Positive Change? 
****To start, we‚Äôre defining it as designing for diversity & inclusion, accessibility, equity & justice, ethics and care & healing. We would be eager to see this evolve and expand over time to include other responsible practices, such as sustainability, circular design, futures/speculative design and beyond.

</aside>

## **Our Goals**

**We aim to build a resource library through co-design that closes these gaps. Our goals are to:**

- Make the universe of resources on designing for positive change easier to access and navigate through thoughtful curation, categorization and personalization
- Surface a diversity of perspectives and lived experiences, with a central focus on those from historically marginalized groups
- Honor the individuals who have brought these resources to life
- Make code, process and learnings transparently accessible to a wider community of creators, designers and developers

## Our Vision for the Library

We envision building a library that is a portal to a multiplicity of perspectives, learnings, approaches, people and communities on design for positive change.

Ideally, it will be:

- Free.
- Open-source.
- Built by the community for the community.
- Interactive and dynamic.
- Thoughtfully curated and categorized.
- Regularly updated.
- Searchable and personalizable.
- Designed with inclusion, accessibility and equity at heart.

*[Current Barebones Library](https://designchangemakers.com/library) - our plan is to rebuild this from scratch*

## Our Team‚Äôs Mantra: ‚ÄúSubvert the Status Quo...with Care‚Äù

We are a scrappy two-person team (for now). We don‚Äôt have any funding or resources but are hoping to harness the power of co-design to bring this vision to life. We‚Äôll have to make realistic tradeoffs along the way in line with the resources at our disposal *(not just in terms of time and skills but also physical, mental and emotional well-being).* 

We will publicly document and share our progress, learnings and challenges as we build to benefit the wider product & design community. We want to subvert the notion that it's not possible to design for accessibility, inclusion and equity when you have limited resources or are building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

üë• **The Team (So far)**

*Distribution of responsibilities will evolve as more folks join in!*

**1.** **[Sandra Camacho](https://linkedin.com/in/sandracamacho)¬†(She/Her)**¬†is an inclusive & equitable design educator and strategist and founder of [Design Changemakers](https://designchangemakers.com) and the [Inclusive Design Jam](https://inclusivedesignjam.com). 

After her recent [health crisis](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL3Bvc3RzL3NhbmRyYWNhbWFjaG9fd29ya2hlYWx0aC1idXJub3V0LWVudHJlcHJlbmV1cnNoaXAtYWN0aXZpdHktNzE3MDQ3NTk5OTA0OTAzOTg3Mi1VQTIt), she was inspired to create this project to better bridge equity approaches with community collaboration.

¬†üìå¬†She‚Äôll be the project lead overseeing product & design strategy, library infrastructure, resource curation, web analytics and UI/UX design.

**2. [kon syrokostas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kon-syrokostas/)¬†(He/Him)**¬†is a¬†Software Engineer, Trauma Recovery Coach and author of the [Trauma-Informed Design Blog](https://medium.com/the-trauma-informed-design-blog). 

He graciously raised his hand to be the first contributor on the team!

¬†üìå¬†He‚Äôll own front-end development and support on product strategy, UI/UX design and resource curation.

## Join the Team / Co-Design Experiment

We're inviting folks of diverse backgrounds and disciplines to co-design with us, starting in March 2024 with the goal of building a first MVP to put into the world by June 2024. The project will continue onwards with ongoing iterations.

If you have skills, lived experience expertise and/or subject matter expertise that can help us bring the library to life in line with our goals and vision, we welcome you to join us!

- *What do we mean by skills, lived experience, and subject matter expertise? What skills are we looking for?*
    
    By **skills**, we mean capabilities in specific areas that you‚Äôve developed personally and professionally over time (*for instance, you are a self-taught or professionally trained UI/UX designer and can bring UI/UX skills into the project).*
    
    <aside>
    üî• We‚Äôre not necessarily looking for ‚Äúexperts‚Äù ‚Äî all skill levels and backgrounds are welcome. But the below skills would be helpful for us to create a solid product!
    
    - UI/UX Design
    - Product Strategy
    - Marketing & Comms
    - User Testing
    - Digital Accessibility
    </aside>
    
    By **lived** **experience**, we mean experiences you‚Äôve had in your life that shape your worldview and perspective *(for instance, you‚Äôre a member of a marginalized group and can speak from that lens to ensure we‚Äôre taking it into account in the design of the library).*
    
    By **subject** **matter** **expertise**, we mean expertise in the subjects covered in the library *(for instance, you have developed expertise in co-design, accessibility or decolonization practices and can advise on resources to include and ways to approach the project).*
    

Whether you have 1 hour to give (or much more), we honor all contributions. 

**üîó¬†[Sign up to join the co-design experiment!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa1Fn_zPlhXwJJjDo8N8mQ4X7qSJqis2MPhBxFCs5G2xaMeg/viewform)**

### **Benefits for Contributors**

We honor your time and energy as a contributor and want to ensure that you fairly benefit from this experience. 

As a baseline, we will provide all contributors the space and freedom to:

- practice co-design
- apply principles & approaches related to positive change/social impact *(i.e. inclusive design, equitable design, ethical design, bias mitigation, diverse representation, accessible design and beyond)*
- work in partnership with values-driven folks across disciplines

Regularly engaged volunteers will also receive discounts to all Design Changemakers learning offerings (once they come back online as the platform is on pause after Sandra‚Äôs [health crisis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sandracamacho_workhealth-burnout-entrepreneurship-activity-7170475999049039872-UA2-)).

If you are a student or career-transitioner, this could be a good opportunity to build your portfolio/resume and showcase your work. We‚Äôre happy to provide testimonials and feedback as a team!

<aside>
üî• **In the event that we get funding, all volunteers will be fairly compensated in accordance with their contributions.**

</aside>

You‚Äôll have the chance to express how you‚Äôd like to benefit from this experience in the [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa1Fn_zPlhXwJJjDo8N8mQ4X7qSJqis2MPhBxFCs5G2xaMeg/viewform). This will help inform how we shape the contributor experience for you.

### **Commitments to Inclusion, Equity, Accessibility & Care**

We aim to ensure a safe, inclusive, accessible and equitable contributor experience for everyone involved in this project. Our commitments include:

- We will use English as our working language, with attention to the use of jargon and complex language
- We will establish community principles (with accountability measures and clearly defined repercussions) that all contributors must abide by to remain on the project
- All meetings will include closed captions and written transcripts of meetings, with agendas sent out ahead of time
- Meetings will be scheduled to accomodate multiple time zones (including creating separate meetings to ensure all global participants can partake)
- Privilege and power structures will not dictate who makes decisions or has the opportunity to weigh in. We will work together to fairly share responsibilities and decision-making power in a way that doesn‚Äôt hinder forward progress.
- We will not adhere to strict timelines, capitalistic pressures or unrealistic standards
- We will allow space and time for creativity, care and community principles to be nurtured and upheld
- We will honor personal requests for accommodations to the best of our ability

*These commitments will evolve over time as others join in and help shape them. 
You can specify any accessibility accommodations and/or volunteer preferences in our [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa1Fn_zPlhXwJJjDo8N8mQ4X7qSJqis2MPhBxFCs5G2xaMeg/viewform)!*
